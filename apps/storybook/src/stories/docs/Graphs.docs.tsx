This documentation will help you setup graphs(*\`more specifically, bar and line graphs\`*) in your react project. We will be using **react-chartjs-2** and **chartjs** to create graphs in our projects. This documentation will walk you through the step to :
1. Setup Dependencies for using react-chartjs-2, 
2. Give code fragments for examples of graphs
3. Link to documentation to provide further help in customisation

# Setup

1. Following packages will be needed to be added to your dependencies
    - **\`react-chartjs-2\`**
    - **\`chart.js\`**
    - **\`Faker\`** (if you want to populate graphs with some random data, **\`optional\`**)

2. Run following commands to add individual packages:
	For Chart.js and React-chartjs-2

	> yarn add chart.js react-charjs.2 --save-dev

	For Faker(only archived version is available as the creator have discontinued the package)

	> yarn add faker@5.5.3 --save-dev
