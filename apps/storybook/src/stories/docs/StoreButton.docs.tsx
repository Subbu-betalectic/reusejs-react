This is sample templates of store buttons. Both Play store and app store.

This template only accept two props:
1. **storeName** : Which can have two values **\`google\`** and **\`apple\`**, one for each store. This prop is **mandatory**
2. **mode** : This prop can have two values **\`dark\`** and **\`light\`**, Default value is \`light\` if no value is given.
3. **responsive** : This prop can have a boolean value i.e. *\`true\`* or *\`false\`*. Default value is true. If false is given the button will not be responsive. Sample3 and Sample6 shows the non-responsive button example while the other examples features a responsive button.

> This is for demo pupose only. Please copy the code fragment for ButtonBase and use as you see fit for any radical customisation
